            Budgeting your personal finances is essential as it provides clarity on your income and expenses, enabling you to control spending, 
            manage debts, and prioritize savings goals effectively. By creating a budget, you gain awareness of your financial situation, 
            allowing you to allocate funds towards important expenses while setting aside money for emergencies and future plans. 
            This not only helps you avoid overspending and debt but also cultivates financial stability, peace of mind, and the 
            ability to achieve long-term financial objectives, ultimately leading to greater control over your financial well-being.

       <h3>The 50/30/20 Model</h3> 
       <p>  
            The 50/30/20 budgeting model is a straightforward method for managing your finances, 
            dividing your after-tax income into three broad categories: 50% for essentials like housing, 
            groceries, and transportation (needs), 30% for discretionary spending on wants like dining out, 
            entertainment, and shopping, and 20% for savings and debt repayment. This approach provides a clear 
            framework for balancing necessary expenses, indulging in non-essential purchases, and prioritizing savings goals, 
            promoting financial stability and responsible money management without requiring detailed tracking of every expense.

     Budgeting model 2: Zero Based 
    <section class="budget-model" id="bgt_mod_2">
       <h3>The "Zero Based" Model</h3> 
       <p>
            The zero-based budgeting model involves allocating every dollar of your income to a specific purpose, 
            ensuring that your income minus expenses equals zero. In this approach, every expense, including necessities, 
            wants, savings, and debt payments, is accounted for, leaving no unassigned funds. Each month, you start from scratch, 
            reassessing your income and expenses and giving every dollar a job, whether it's covering bills, building an emergency fund, 
            paying off debt, or saving for future goals. This method encourages prioritization, conscious spending, and proactive 
            financial planning, empowering individuals to take control of their finances and align their spending with their values and goals.

    Budgeting model 3: "Pay Yourself First" 
    <section class="budget-model" id="bgt_mod_3">
       <h3>The "Pay Yourself First" Model</h3> 
       <div class ="text-container">
            <p>
        The "pay yourself first" model is a financial strategy that prioritizes saving a portion of your income before 
        allocating funds to expenses or discretionary spending. Essentially, it involves treating savings as a non-negotiable 
        expense that must be paid before anything else. When you receive your income, whether it's a paycheck or any other 
        source, you immediately set aside a predetermined percentage or amount into savings or investment accounts. This ensures 
        that you're consistently building savings and working towards your financial goals, whether it's an emergency fund, 
        retirement savings, or other objectives. By making saving a priority, you establish a habit of financial discipline 
        and ensure that your future financial security is not compromised by current expenses or lifestyle choices.
